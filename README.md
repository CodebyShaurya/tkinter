Dumb Detector with Tkinter

Overview

A lightweight Tkinter project that playfully asks the user if they are dumb. The application provides two buttons - "Yes" and "No." If the user clicks "No," the application humorously changes its placement on the screen. If the user clicks "Yes," a message is printed to the console saying "I knew it."

Features

Simple Tkinter GUI.

Interactive "Are you dumb?" question.

Dynamic placement adjustment on clicking "No."

Console message on clicking "Yes."
